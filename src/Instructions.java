	Given the following rules for the game of dice, create a program that prints out whether you won or lost on each roll. Below are the requirements for this program. 

	The player rolls two 6-sided dice (hint: use 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) ) to generate a random number between 1 and 6.

	Rolling 7 or 11 on the first try is a WIN 
	Rolling 2, 3 or 12 on the first try is a LOSE 
	Any other roll on the first try becomes the player's POINT 
	If a player rolled POINT, the player continues to roll until one of two things happens:
	If a player has POINT and rolls the POINT again, it is a WIN 
	If a player has POINT and rolls 7, it is a LOST 

	Example runs:

	You rolled 7.
	You win!

	You rolled 12.
	You lose!

	You rolled 4. POINT is 4.
	You rolled 3. POINT is 4.
	You rolled 11. POINT is 4.
	You rolled 4.
	You win!
}
